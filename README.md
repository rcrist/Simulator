# Simulator
Dedicated simulator in C# for 8-Bit Breadboard Computer

This project is a simulator for an 8-Bit Breadboard Computer inspired by Ben Eater at eater.net.  The simulator provides a GUI which displays the LEDs, LED bars, and 7-Segment Display of a breadboard computer.  The code was written in VS2019 using C# and WinForms.  Key technologies used in the development is a publish-subscribe system, custom controls, and a test panel to simulate the Program Control Unit (PCU).  Binaries for debug and release are provided in the bin directory.
